# Mysterious-Cloak
"The Mysterious Cloak" is a project that leverages computer vision and image 
processing techniques to create an illusion of invisibility similar to the mythical 
invisibility cloak seen in various works of fiction. The project captures video 
from a webcam, identifies a specific colour range (in this case, red), and 
replaces it with the background scene, giving the impression that objects of 
that colour are invisible.

System Requirements: Python 3 , OpenCV, Numpy installed.
